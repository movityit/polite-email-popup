# Polite Email Popup

A customizeable and accessible email sign up form that pops up when it's polite to do so.

### Reason

You want to grow your audience as much as possible, but also be polite about it.

This plugin was made for small businesses and indie makers who want a simple all-in-one solution for collecting email addresses. 

**Polite Email Popup** makes sure visitors are engaged with your content *before* asking for their email addresses.

### Features

* When this plugin detects a user is engaged with your content, it will trigger:
  * An email sign up form along the bottom of your page
  * An exit-intent modal (which is disabled on mobile)

* The modal's accessibility features
  * The `aria-hidden` attribute is toggled on modal and page content
  * Focus is trapped within the modal while it's open
  * The focus position is put back where it was taken from before toggling the modal
  * The first focusable element within the modal (the email input) is focused when it opens

### Politeness Rules

These rules determine when the modal and bottom bar sign up forms trigger.
